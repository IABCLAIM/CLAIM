# CLAIM - Common Ledger of Authenticated Identities for Marketing

## Introduction
To prevent domain fraud IAB Labs have pioneered the ads.txt solution. For the last few years a new technology has sprung to mind when talking about ways to prevent fraud and establish trust. That technology is called blockchain and CLAIM is our attempt to port ads.txt to a blockchain environment.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CxynECoKaoSrUYy0kVGztYrK6SyLNJBu/view?usp=sharing) here is a link describing how CLAIM works on a conceptual level.

## Deployment
CLAIM is currently deployed to the Ethereum network and the contract is written in solidity. You can review the code [here](contracts/claim.sol).

## Try it yourself
IAB Denmark is currently hosting a web UI for you to generate your own blockchain-powered ads.txt. Visit [http://claim.iabdanmark.dk](http://claim.iabdanmark.dk) to test it. Also check out the [server](server) folder to see how we configured the server.

## Contributions
The CLAIM initiative is open source and contributions are encouraged. If you have any suggestions feel free to create a pull request.
